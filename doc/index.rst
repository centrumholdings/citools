====================
CI tools
====================

Ultimate goal of Continuous Integration tools is to provide "integration button", magic key hit that will do everything needed for product to build & deploy. While there are some tools available, none of those fullfills our real-world needs.

Basic idea is simple: use setup.py in similar fashion as Makefiles or ant, but take advantage of setuptools plugin system to provide globally available commands, easily configurable for every project.

We are making some assumptions about project structure and needs. If you need to configure something more, let us know, or just `fork us at github <http://github.com/ella/citools/tree/master>`_ and send us Your pull request.
